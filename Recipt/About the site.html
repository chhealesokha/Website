    <h1>About Jen's Kitchen </h1>
    <a href="About.html">back to the home page</a>
    <p>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. Bon Appetit!

        The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
        
        If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.</p>
